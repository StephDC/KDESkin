# KDESkin
An update of the old osu! KDE Skin by StephDeChine (StephDC). Replace Oxygen icons by Breeze and other enhancements. Images produces are licensed under CC-BY-SA 4.0 or higher.

## Target
Allow us to build the KDESkin.osk osu! skin file with a single execution of buildSkin.sh

## Dependency
- Bash - GNU Bourne-Again SHell, other POSIX compatible shell should also work.
- ImageMagick - Currently using ImageMagick 6 but might use 7 in the future.
